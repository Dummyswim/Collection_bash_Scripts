# Collection_bash_Scripts

I have seen many good bash/shell scripts available on internet or any websites like stak_over_flow. I have tried to collect python scripts or create the scripts by myself referring to internet or the programs available and feel this could help anyone as per their requirement.
Source links are provided if programs are copied and I hold no authority on these programs. These are just collections for education purposes.
If you feel the program/(s) should not be on this repository/website. Please email me @balajichavdi@yahoo.com, I will take it down with immediate effect.
